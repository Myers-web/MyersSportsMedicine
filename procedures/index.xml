      <description>The Donjoy Ultrasling Quadrant is a state of the art shoulder brace designed to stabilize the upper limb after shoulder surgery. The brace was designed by Dr. Myers for the comfort and rehabilitation of his patients. This is one of the many innovations that Dr. Myers has contributed to the field of orthopaedic surgery. 3 years in development, the Ultrasling Quadrant has many advantages over the prior shoulder immobilizers.
 Patient comfort - The Ultrasling Quadrant stabilizes the arm by supporting its weight on the hip as well as suspending it from the opposite shoulder with a strap.</description>
