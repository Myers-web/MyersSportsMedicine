Sports medicine specializes in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of injuries and conditions related to 
participation in sports and/or exercise, specifically the rotation or deformation of 
joints or muscles caused by engaging in such physical activities. 
While athletes and sports-related injuries are the primary focus of sports medicine physicians, any patients who wish to focus on maintaining an active lifestyle following treatment may benefit from seeing a sports medicine physician. 
With a combination of exemplary care, state-of-the-art medical procedures, and in-house physical therapy, the team at Myers Sports Medicine and Orthoapedic Center is dedicated to helping patients maintain an active lifestyle during and following their treatment.
