Kristiann Settles obtained her Bachelor of Science in Exercise & Health Science from 
Kennesaw State University in 2014. Early in her studies, Kristiann conducted an analysis 
in Biomechanics, which stimulated an interest in orthopaedic rehabilitation and 
encouraged her to assist in rehabilitating a variety of athletes and athletics-related 
injuries. She has now worked with student-athletes from, amongst others, Atlanta 
International School, Blessed Trinity, Galloway, Lovett, Marist, Pace, West Minister, 
and Woodward. After spending several months engaged in the rehabilitation of these 
injuries, Kristiann refocused her attention to the operative side of Orthopaedics, and 
in the spring of 2015, she accepted a position at Myers Sports Medicine and Orthopaedic 
Center. Kristiann is now a clinical assistant to Dr. Thomas Myers.
