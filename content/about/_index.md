Our practice is a state of the art facility fully equipped with three exam suites, a complete physical therapy facility and a luxurious waiting room. A 
media center is available so that you may experience educational videos and thoroughly 
understand the specific types of treatments that are offered. Patients enjoy the ease of 
an online past medical history form rather than spending hours filling out meaningless 
paperwork. An electronic medical record system is used which assists in the quick 
turnover of medical notes and referrals.
