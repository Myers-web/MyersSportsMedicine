### Why Concierge Services?
<hr>
Dramatic changes in our country’s health care system have created many challenges for 
private practices. Like others, we have seen our waiting times increase as our practice 
has grown. Rather than turning portions of your medical treatment over to Physician’s 
Assistants or nurse practitioners, our doctors wish to maintain personal contact with you 
throughout your medical treatment.  This direct and consistent contact is, we feel, the 
core of good medical care.

**Our goal is not to inconvenience any patient by long waiting times prior to appointments.** 
We greatly appreciate your ongoing confidence in our doctors and the role you have played 
in our growth through your referrals.

<br>
### Cost vs. Value
<hr>
These expedited evaluations are offered as an additional out-of-pocket cost to our 
clients for whom “time is money”. We hope the time-savings will help you meet other 
scheduling requirements and maximize your time with our doctors by limiting the time 
spent in the office on administrative tasks.

appointment, simply make the request when you are scheduling your appointment.
