Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) injections are a new technology that uses natural healing factors to treat chronic injuries.

PRP injections are most commonly used for tendonitis or chronic injuries such as:

* Tennis/Golfer’s Elbow aka Lateral/Medial Epicondylitis
* Achilles Tendonitis
* Plantar Fasciitis
* Chronic Hamstring Strains
* Runner’s Knee aka Patellar Tendonitis
* Other uses can be discussed with the physician as indicated, however these are the most common at this time

# What is PRP?  
Platelet Rich Plasma is a concentration of platelets and growth factors created from a small amount of your own blood. Increased levels of growth factors improve signaling and recruitment of cells to an injury site and optimize the environment of healing.

# How does the PRP process work?  
Dr. Myers can perform this procedure in the office with minimal to no side effects. After a small amount of blood is recovered from the patient’s arm using a small needle and syringe, the blood will go through a rapid spinning process that separates and concentrates the platelets and other beneficial growth factors from the blood. The plasma containing these platelets and growth factors are then applied to the treatment area via an injection. This process is usually performed in 20-30 minutes.

# What are the risks associated with this treatment?  
PRP uses your own body’s natural properties to treat your injury. Side effects utilizing PRP systems are very uncommon.
