At **Myers Sports Medicine and Orthopaedic Center**, we recognize that navigating healthcare costs can be challenging. To make your care more accessible and straightforward, we proudly offer transparent self-pay pricing for our services. Self-pay rates are available exclusively for payments made in full at the time of service.

<br>

*Please note: commercial and government-sponsored insurance plans do not qualify for self-pay pricing and cannot be submitted for out-of-network reimbursement.*

<br>

## Who Benefits from Bundled Pricing?
<hr style="margin-bottom:10px;">


Our self-pay pricing is designed for:
- Self-pay patients
- Self-insured employers
- Health-sharing ministry members
- Individuals responsible for their healthcare out-of-pocket expenses

<br>

## Important Details
<hr style="margin-bottom:10px;">
Each surgical bundle covers treatment for a single body part and includes the surgeon’s fee, which encompasses the pre-operative appointment, surgery, and post-operative follow-up visit. For example, treatment for your right knee and left shoulder would require two (2) separate bundles. An evaluation appointment is required to determine if surgery is necessary, and the cost for this evaluation is listed below. The evaluation ensures you receive a personalized treatment plan, and if surgery is recommended, we’ll provide a detailed cost estimate tailored to your needs.

<br>

The bundled pricing applies only to the surgeon’s fee. Additional costs, such as facility fees, anesthesia, or post-operative physical therapy, are separate and may be submitted to your insurance provider.

<br>

*Durable Medical Equipment (DME) ordered during your visit is not included in the package pricing and will be billed separately.*
