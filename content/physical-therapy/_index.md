## What We Do

Georgia Sports Medicine Specialists provides a comprehensive approach to sports medicine and orthopaedics.  This includes: 

1. **Evaluation** of orthopaedic and sports injuries. 
2. **Treatment** of these injuries through conservative measures including physical therapy and referrals to other specialists such as orthopaedic surgeons. 
3. **Prevention** of injury/reinjury through our Performance Institute’s sports performance programs.

As orthopedic and sports medicine experts, our Doctors of Physical Therapy conduct a thorough **evaluation**.  This evaluation is designed to not only diagnose the presenting condition but, just as importantly, assess “why” they have this condition.

**Treatment** of orthopaedic and sports injuries is centered on **physical therapy**.  Our staff is committed to providing excellence in a caring environment.  We have and will continue to provide cutting edge strategies that set the standard for sports and orthopaedic physical therapy.

**Longevity** in sports participation is determined in part by minimizing risk factors associated with injuries.  Our **Sports Performance & Physical Enhancement Programs** are managed by sports medicine professionals to include Doctors of Physical Therapy and Certified Athletic Trainers.  Combining our years of experience in sports medicine and sports performance training we bring a level of expertise that is unmatched.  The objective is to develop physical and mental attributes, in a fun environment, that will positively impact participation levels in all sports.  The program addresses performance gains as well as injury risks with the goal of playing at the highest level possible for as long as possible.
