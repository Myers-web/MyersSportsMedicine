The RIO&reg; Robotic Arm Interactive Orthopedic System features three dimensional pre-surgical planning. During surgery, the RIO&reg; provides the surgeon with real-time visual, tactile and auditory feedback to facilitate optimal joint resurfacing and implant positioning. It is this optimal placement that can result in more natural knee motion following surgery.

## RIO&reg; Features:
<hr>
Accurately plan implant size, orientation and alignment utilizing CT-derived 3-D modeling
Enabling the pre-resection capture of patient-specific kinematic tracking through full flexion and extension
Real-time intra-operative adjustments for correct knee kinematics and soft-tissue balance
Minimally invasive and bone sparing, with minimal tissue trauma for faster recovery
