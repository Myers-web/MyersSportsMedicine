## Why has Dr. Myers transitioned to a cash-pay model?
Dr. Myers has made the decision to shift to a cash-pay model to protect and restore the integrity of the physician-patient relationship. Over the years, insurance companies have increasingly interfered with medical decisions by limiting treatment options, delaying necessary care, and denying coverage for essential procedures.

Dr. Myers believes that patient care should be dictated by the needs and well-being of the patient, not by the policies of insurance companies. This model allows Dr. Myers to provide timely, personalized care without compromise.

<br>

## What are the benefits of the cash-pay model for patients?
<hr style="margin-bottom:10px;">

- **Direct, Transparent Pricing** – Patients know exactly what services cost upfront, without hidden fees or unexpected bills.
- **No Insurance Barriers** – Patients receive care based on medical necessity and expert judgment, not insurance requirements or coverage limitations.
- **Faster Access to Care** – Eliminating insurance pre-approvals and administrative delays allows for quicker appointments and treatment plans.
- **Enhanced Physician Interaction** – Dr. Myers can spend more time with patients, focusing on personalized care rather than navigating insurance red tape.

<br>

## How does payment work under this model?
Patients are required to pay for services at the time of their appointment. For new patient evaluations, the cost is $320. This fee covers the consultation but does not include imaging or procedures, which will be discussed and billed separately. Payment methods include cash, check, credit card, debit card, and HSA/FSA cards.

## Can I still use my insurance to get reimbursed?
Starting January 1st, 2025, Dr. Myers will no longer accept commercial or government insurance for office visits or procedures. However, you can still use your insurance at the surgery center for hospital fees and anesthesia, as well as for physical therapy services as those are separate entities from Myers Sports Medicine and Orthopaedic Center and have their own billing practices. Upon request, we can provide patients with a detailed receipt for Dr. Myers’ services. It is important to understand that reimbursement is not guaranteed, and Myers Sports Medicine does not assist with filing claims or engaging in the reimbursement process.

<br>

## Why doesn’t Myers Sports Medicine accept insurance directly?
Insurance companies have created layers of administrative obstacles that delay care and reduce the quality of treatment patients receive. By opting out of the insurance model, Dr. Myers ensures that medical decisions are made based solely on what is best for the patient. This model eliminates unnecessary paperwork, allowing our team to focus on providing exceptional orthopedic care.

<br>

## What if I have a high-deductible insurance plan or no insurance at all?
Many patients with high-deductible plans find the cash-pay model beneficial because it often costs less than paying for services out of pocket until their deductible is met. Additionally, patients without insurance can receive high-quality care without worrying about network restrictions or inflated insurance rates.

<br>

## How do I schedule an appointment?
Scheduling is easy. Simply call our office at (404) 352-8156, and one of our staff members will assist you. Payment for the initial evaluation is required at the time of scheduling to confirm your appointment.

<br>

## What should I expect at my first visit?
During your initial consultation, Dr. Myers will conduct a thorough evaluation, discuss your medical history, and develop a personalized treatment plan. If x-rays or other imaging are required, we will provide you with a cost estimate before proceeding.

<br>

## Who can I contact if I have further questions?
