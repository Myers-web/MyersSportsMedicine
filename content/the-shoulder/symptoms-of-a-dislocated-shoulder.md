Shoulder dislocation is a common injury that usually results from a wide variety of sports. 
Generally when a shoulder is dislocated, the head of the humerus (the upper arm bone) is 
forced forwards when the arm is turned outwards and being held out to the side. This 
dislocation, known as an anterior dislocation, makes up approximately 95% of all shoulder 
dislocations.

The other 5% of dislocations, posterior dislocations, inferior dislocations, superior 
dislocations, or intra thoracic dislocations, are rarer. These can also cause a large amount 
of complications and damage to surrounding structures such as muscles, tendons, or nerves. 
Posterior are the second most common type of dislocation with 3% or dislocations being 
posterior.

Because the shoulder has such a high mobility it is particularly prone to being dislocated. 
It is the most commonly dislocated joint, ahead of elbow, knee, finger and wrist 
dislocations. Shoulder dislocations can become a reoccurring problem, so some people choose 
to learn how to re-position the shoulder on their own. This is not recommended as it can 
cause more damage than fixed if the person is inexperienced.
