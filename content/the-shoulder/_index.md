Many patients come into our office complaining of [Rotator Cuff Tears]({{< ref "symptoms-of-a-rotator-cuff-tear.md" >}}), when in fact very few 
actually have a tear. There are several etiologies to shoulder pain; Adhesive Capsulitis 
([frozen shoulder]({{< ref "frozen-shoulder.md" >}})), Subacromial Bursitis, Supraspinatus Tendonitis, Glenohumeral Instability, 
Chondrocalcinosis, Osteoarthritis, Gout, Lyme Arthritis, Bicipital Tendonitis, Ganglion Cyst 
are but a few possible causes of shoulder pain. It is best to think of cause of injury/pain 
and age in making generalizations for diagnosing shoulder pain.

## Diagnosing Shoulder Problems
The art of diagnosing shoulder problems is to relate the two above with a good history from 
the patient and a comprehensive shoulder exam. Believe it or not, there are over 50 shoulder 
exam tests that can be done by the examining physician alone, without the use of x-rays, 
MRI’s, or arthrograms. The latter test may be used to confirm a clinical suspicion or in 
difficult cases, to aid in the diagnosis, but a patient’s history of injury/pain and a good 
shoulder directed physical examination will usually suffice in making a diagnosis and 
treatment plan. Many of these problems are approached in a non-operative manner with 
medications, rest, ice, and physical therapy suplemented with cortisone injections on 
occasion. If an operation is needed, most of these conditions can be treated by arthroscopic 
(scope) techniques, with limited incisions and usually done as a same day surgery.

Initiating early treatment for shoulder problems is often the best curative course. If you 
recognize these symptoms, you should make a prompt appointment to have it evaluated further 
by your primary care physician or an orthopedic surgeon.
