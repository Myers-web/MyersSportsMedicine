Adhesive capsulitis is when a person loses the ability to move their shoulder around in 
all directions without pain. This problem is commonly referred to as a frozen shoulder, 
as the shoulder usually becomes stiff and will be hard to move at all. The causes of 
ashesive capsulitis are somewhat unknown and tend to happen randomly.

## What are the Symptoms of Adhesive Capsulitis?

A shoulder should be able to move in all directions without any stiffness or pain. If you 
aren’t able to do the following with your shoulder, you possibly could be suffering from 
adhesive capsulitis.

* Raise your arms out to the sides of your body
* Reach up towards the sky with both arms
* Pretend you are trying to unzip you’re the back of a dress or pull out your wallet from the back of your pants
* Reach our straight in front of you

Always consult a doctor if you think you have a medical condition such as this. You 
doctor may be able to diagnose you just by watching you move and listening to your 
symptoms. The doctor may apply pressure to areas of your should to see what exactly is 
causing pain. Xray scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of your shoulder may 
be required to further check the problems.

## What are the Causes of Adhesive Capsulitis?

These injuries often occur after you have been less active due to other injuries, such as 
a torn rotator cuff, broken arm, or surgery recovery. These develop when connective 
tissue in your should joint tightens, which restricts movement of the joint. Adults over 
40 are more at risk than other age groups, with women being especially prone to the 
injury.
