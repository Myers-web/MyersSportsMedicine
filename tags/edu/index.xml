      <description>Many patients come into our office complaining of Rotator Cuff Tears, when in fact very few actually have a tear. There are several etiologies to shoulder pain; Adhesive Capsulitis (frozen shoulder), Subacromial Bursitis, Supraspinatus Tendonitis, Glenohumeral Instability, Chondrocalcinosis, Osteoarthritis, Gout, Lyme Arthritis, Bicipital Tendonitis, Ganglion Cyst are but a few possible causes of shoulder pain. It is best to think of cause of injury/pain and age in making generalizations for diagnosing shoulder pain.</description>

      <description>In human anatomy, the knee is the lower extremity joint connecting the femur and the tibia. Since in humans the knee supports nearly the entire weight of the body, it is vulnerable both to acute injury and to the development of osteoarthritis.
Function Of The Knee The knee functions as a living, self-maintaining, biologic transmission, the purpose of which is to accept and transfer biomechanical loads between the femur, tibia, patella, and fibula.</description>
