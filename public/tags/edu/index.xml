      <description>Many patients enter our office complaining of shoulder pain, suggesting that they have torn their rotator cuff. In actuality, very few patients have a true Rotator Cuff Tear. There are several etiologies to shoulder pain besides a torn rotator cuff; Adhesive Capsulitis (frozen shoulder), Subacromial Bursitis, Tendinitis, Glenohumeral Instability, Chondrocalcinosis, Osteoarthritis, Gout, Lyme arthritis, and Ganglion Cysts are but a few possible causes of shoulder pain. When diagnosing shoulder pain, it is important to consider the method of injury as well as patient age and lifestyle to determine a patient&amp;rsquo;s actual condition.</description>

      <description>In human anatomy, the knee is the lower extremity joint connecting the femur and the tibia. Tthe knee supports nearly the entire weight of the body, and as a result it is prone to both acute injuries like ligament tears and chronic injuries such as osteoarthritis.
 Function Of The Knee  The knee functions as a living, self-maintaining, biologic transmission, designed to accept and transfer biomechanical loads between the femur, tibia, patella, and fibula.</description>

While athletes and sports-related injuries are the primary focus of sports medicine physicians, any patients who wish to focus on maintaining an active lifestyle following treatment may benefit from seeing a sports medicine physician.
